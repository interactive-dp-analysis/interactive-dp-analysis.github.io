  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">Hi, I’m __________ and I’ll be leading the study today.
  </p>
  <ul><li class="svelte-mbfo8m"><span class="act svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="action made">Confirm that the participant filled out the consent form. If they have
        not, ask if they have any questions before filling it out.</span></li>

  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">In this study you will be given a set of visualizations and asked to answer
    some questions about the data. Your goal is to answer questions about the
    data as accurately as possible. While you will earn $25 for completing the
    study alone, you can earn additional payment during the study. There is an
    upper bound of $30 on the additional payment—please note that it is an upper
    bound, so you may only receive a portion of that payment depending on your
    answers.
  </p>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">Before we begin, I’ll give you some additional background related to the
    task and walk you through a tutorial question. You can ask me questions
    along the way.
  </p>
  <h4 class="svelte-mbfo8m">Tutorial (7 min.)</h4>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">Oftentimes data analyses are conducted on sensitive or private data (for
    example, health data). Today I’ll show you a tool for analyzing such data in
    a privacy-preserving manner.
  </p>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">Specifically, the tool displays privacy-preserving graphs of some data.
    These graphs are created by injecting statistical noise into the data to
    protect confidentiality. So, each graph shows the data with some amount of
    noise added, meaning the data you see will be somewhat inaccurate. We think
    of each graph as a “measurement” of the true data.
  </p>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">In conducting a data analysis, there are often questions you want to answer.
    How much you care about the accuracy of the answers you get might differ
    across questions. Therefore, the tool gives you the option of “remeasuring”
    a graph to get slightly better accuracy. Each time you remeasure, you will
    increase the accuracy of the graph.
  </p>
  <ul><li class="svelte-mbfo8m"><span class="act svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="action made">Share screen (for the interface).</span></li></ul>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">This is a tutorial question. In the main study you’ll be asked to answer
    multiple questions, but for now let’s look at just this one. The question is
    listed at the top and below you’ll find two visualizations that will help
    you answer the question. This dataset is based on the Census Current
    Population Survey.
  </p>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">The errors represent the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the estimate.
    These can help you get a sense of how far from the actual value the estimate
    is.
  </p>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">You can select bars on either visualization to filter the data. Clicking a
    bar on the left means that the visualization on the right will only show
    data for the clicked bar. You can clear the filter either by clicking that
    bar again, or by clicking this “clear filter” button.
    <strong>Note: You can filter for the left AND right.</strong></p>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">I’ll pause here to let you think about how you might answer this question.
  </p>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">To improve accuracy of the estimates, you can “remeasure” the visualization.
    <span class="act svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="action made">The investigator clicks the remeasure button</span> Notice that there are now gray error bars beneath the solid black error bars.
    These represent previous errors before remeasurement. Currently they are centered
    around the new estimate.
  </p>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">However, if you want to see the previous errors centered around the previous
    estimate, you can use this toggle button.
  </p>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">You can also change the y-axis scales to get a more “zoomed in” view of the
    data.
  </p>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">You can hover bars to get exact numerical information about estimates and
    errors.
  </p>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">Notice that we specify how to provide an answer. In this question we ask for
    an interval in which you are 95% confident that the true answer lies.
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-mbfo8m"><span class="act svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="action made">Give participant remote control of screen and allow them to test out the
      tutorial question.</span></p>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">Do you have any questions?</p>
  <h4 class="svelte-mbfo8m">Tasks (45 min.)</h4>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">Now we’ll move on to the main portion of this study. There will be three
    sections. Each section will have four questions, and an upper bound of $10
    you can earn. Each question is worth the same amount. We’ll spend about
    10-12 minutes on each section. There isn&#39;t a strict time limit on sections
    but I&#39;ll be giving you reminders about how much time you should plan to
    spend before wrapping up so you finish the study on time.
  </p>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">Each section will ask you questions about a different dataset. Your task is
    to answer these questions as accurately as possible using a limited number
    of remeasures – you’ll get six remeasures per section. You may allocate
    remeasures across visualizations however you like. For example, you can
    spend all remeasures on only one question, or you could split them more
    evenly across questions.
  </p>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">There will be two question types that you’ll see, quantitative and binary.
    Quantitative questions will be like what you saw in the tutorial (“how
    many…”?) while binary questions will ask for the probability you believe the
    answer is yes vs no. For quantitative questions make sure your answer is
    within 0, 1000 because there are only 1000 records in each dataset. And for
    binary make sure the probabilities sum to 1.
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-mbfo8m"><span class="act svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="action made">Explain scoring rules at a high level &amp; point them to the additional
      document</span></p>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">Your goal is to decide how to use your remeasures so as to get the best
    possible score, and therefore increase the additional payment you receive.
  </p>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script">These tasks are challenging, so we don’t expect anyone to answer everything
    perfectly. Just do your best. Please also think aloud as you complete the
    tasks. It’s especially helpful for us to hear your decision-making process.
    If you are struggling with something, please talk through it. I’ll also keep
    reminding you to think aloud during the task.
  </p>
  <p aria-label="description">Participant completes tasks on three blocks (Census, Diabetes, Student). The
    order of blocks was counterbalanced across participants. Questions were
    randomly ordered in each block.
  </p>
  <p class="script svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="script"><span class="act svelte-mbfo8m" aria-label="action made">On the first block</span> I want to
    remind you that you can look over all the questions first before spending remeasures,
    if you’d like.
